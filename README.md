# SFML_Pong_Game
Simple SFML game for two players.

Opening .sln file in Visual Studio and runing seems to do the job.

Or you can try to manually compile .cpp file using SFML-2.5.1 folder containing all required libraries.


Debug creates an .exe file that uses .dll (sfml-xxx-2) files to run, Release creates an .exe file that runs without them (you still need .ttf file tho).

To control the players use the A, D and J, L keys.










I dont know what the heck im doing.
Good luck.
